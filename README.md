## 🚀 Project Overview

**The Challenge:** Public libraries face a "digital divide" where older adults and newcomers struggle to access digital services due to anxiety, lack of support, and systemic design failures.

**The Solution:** The **Senior Tech Ambassadors Program** — a peer mentorship model that transforms library users with teaching experience into certified digital literacy mentors. This shifts the model from dependency to empowerment.
